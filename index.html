    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
        attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> There are several well-established practices that have been demonstrated to be
        effective. Below follows some recommendations for enhancing the security of your website and protecting it from
        web security attacks.
    <ul>
        <li>You should ensure that the authentication and authorization process is difficult to crack. By using an
            authorization protocol or a framework you can ensure this. </li>
        <li>Keep the data sanitized. Ensuring that the data is in the right format can be done manually or with a
            sanitize package. </li>
        <li>You should always research your third-party applications to ensure they are trustworthy and used by other
            satisfied customers. Use trusted networks and hosts to connect to. </li>
        <li>By using an automatic process of integration and delivering code to production also called Continuus
            Deployment (CD) or Continuous Integration (CI) will assist in maintaining the reliability of the
            modifications being made to the codebase </li>
        <li>Implement automatic user timeout to protect user credentials. </li>
        <li>And on a final note, it is crucial to maintain a constant state of awareness and exercising caution when
            opening emails and clicking on links. </li>
    </ul>
